It  is  also  more strict than a regular install, which can help catch errors or inconsistencies caused by the incrementally-installed  local  environments of most npm users. In short, the main differences between using npm install and npm ci are: \u00b7 The project must have an existing package-lock.json or npm-shrinkwrap.json. \u00b7 If dependencies in the package lock do not match those in package.json, npm ci will exit with an error, instead of updating the package lock. \u00b7 npm ci can only install entire projects at a time:  individual  dependencies  cannot  be added with this command. \u00b7 If  a  node_modules  is  already present, it will be automatically removed before npm ci begins its install. \u00b7 It will  never  write  to  package.json  or  any  of  the  package-locks:  installs  are essentially frozen.

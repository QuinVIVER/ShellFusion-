      "MP Summary": "as the filename. --logdir <name> Writes each synchronization log output in a new file in the specified directory. --logexpire <hours> Removes logs older than the value specified (in hours). This command is  used  with --logdir. --logflush Clears (flushes) the log file after each write action. --logdebug Also  output  debug-level  messages  in  the log (equivalent to setting the env var QT_LOGGING_RULES=\"qt.*=true;*.debug=true\"). ) --confdir <dirname> Uses the specified configuration directory. The ownCloud Client reads a configuration file.  You can locate this configuration file as follows: On Linux distributions: $HOME/.config/ownCloud/owncloud.cfg On Microsoft Windows systems: %APPDATA%\\ownCloud\\owncloud.cfg On MAC OS X systems: $HOME/Library/Preferences/ownCloud/owncloud.cfg The configuration file contains settings using the Microsoft Windows .ini file format. You can overwrite changes using the ownCloud configuration dialog. NOTE: Use caution when making changes to the ownCloud Client configuration  file.

You can also use -y/--yes to skip the questionnaire altogether.  If  you pass --scope, it will create a scoped package.

      "MP Summary": "presumably creating or updating package.json and running any other initialization-related operations. The init command is transformed to a corresponding npx operation as follows: \u00b7 npm init foo -> npx create-foo \u00b7 npm init @usr/foo -> npx @usr/create-foo \u00b7 npm init @usr -> npx @usr/create Any  additional  options  will  be passed directly to the command, so npm init foo --hello will map to npx create-foo --hello. If the initializer is omitted (by just calling npm init), init will fall  back  to  legacy init  behavior.  It  will  ask you a bunch of questions, and then write a package.json for you. It will attempt to make reasonable guesses based on  existing  fields,  dependencies, and  options selected. It is strictly additive, so it will keep any fields and values that were already set. You can also use -y/--yes to skip the questionnaire altogether.  If  you pass --scope, it will create a scoped package.

This\n is particularly useful when you want to send several different directories at the\n same time. For example, if you used this command:",

This command is  used  with --logdir. --logflush Clears (flushes) the log file after each write action. --logdebug Also  output  debug-level  messages  in  the log (equivalent to setting the env var QT_LOGGING_RULES=\"qt.*=true;*.debug=true\"). ) --confdir <dirname> Uses the specified configuration directory.

You can locate this configuration file as follows: On Linux distributions: $HOME/.config/ownCloud/owncloud.cfg On Microsoft Windows systems: %APPDATA%\\ownCloud\\owncloud.cfg On MAC OS X systems: $HOME/Library/Preferences/ownCloud/owncloud.cfg The configuration file contains settings using the Microsoft Windows .ini file format. You can overwrite changes using the ownCloud configuration dialog. NOTE: Use caution when making changes to the ownCloud Client configuration  file.

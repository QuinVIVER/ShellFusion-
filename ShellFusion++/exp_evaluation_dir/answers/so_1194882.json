The init command is transformed to a corresponding npx operation as follows: \u00b7 npm init foo -> npx create-foo \u00b7 npm init @usr/foo -> npx @usr/create-foo \u00b7 npm init @usr -> npx @usr/create Any  additional  options  will  be passed directly to the command, so npm init foo --hello will map to npx create-foo --hello. If the initializer is omitted (by just calling npm init), init will fall  back  to  legacy init  behavior.  It  will  ask you a bunch of questions, and then write a package.json for you. It will attempt to make reasonable guesses based on  existing  fields,  dependencies, and  options selected. It is strictly additive, so it will keep any fields and values that were already set. You can also use -y/--yes to skip the questionnaire altogether.  If  you pass --scope, it will create a scoped package.

It will attempt to make reasonable guesses based on  existing  fields,  dependencies, and  options selected. It is strictly additive, so it will keep any fields and values that were already set. You can also use -y/--yes to skip the questionnaire altogether.  If  you pass --scope, it will create a scoped package.

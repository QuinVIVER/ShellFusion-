        "-Z": "Output a zero byte (the ASCII NUL character) instead of the character that normally\n follows a file name. For example, grep -lZ outputs a zero byte after each file\n name instead of the usual newline. This option makes the output unambiguous, even\n in the presence of file names containing unusual characters like newlines. This\n option can be used with commands like find -print0, perl -0, sort -z, and xargs -0\n to process arbitrary file names, even those that contain newline characters.",
        "-n": "Prefix each line of output with the 1-based line number within its input file.",
        "-v": "Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.",
        "-z": "Treat input and output data as sequences of lines, each terminated by a zero byte\n (the ASCII NUL character) instead of a newline. Like the -Z or --null option, this\n option can be used with commands like sort -z to process arbitrary file names.",
        "-i": "Ignore case distinctions in patterns and input data, so that characters that differ\n only in case match each other."

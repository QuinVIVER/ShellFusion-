                "-r(M)": " resumes a detached screen session. No other options (except combinations with -d/-D)\n may be specified, though an optional prefix of [pid.]tty.host may be needed to\n distinguish between multiple detached screen sessions. The second form is used to\n connect to another user's screen session which runs in multiuser mode. This indicates\n that screen should look for sessions in another user's directory. This requires\n setuid-root.",
                "-wipe(M)": "does the same as \"screen -ls\", but removes destroyed sessions instead of marking them\n as `dead'. An unreachable session is considered dead, when its name matches either\n the name of the local host, or the explicitly given parameter, if any. See the -r\n flag for a description how to construct matches."

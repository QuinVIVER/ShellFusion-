                "--delete-excluded(C)": " Try this one. -m deletes \"empty\" directories that were created while traversing SRS sub directories, and --delete-excluded to make rsync not look like cp.",
                "--delete-excluded(M)": "In addition to deleting the files on the receiving side that are not on the sending\n side, this tells rsync to also delete any files on the receiving side that are\n excluded (see --exclude). See the FILTER RULES section for a way to make\n individual exclusions behave this way on the receiver, and for a way to protect\n files from --delete-excluded. See --delete (which is implied) for more details on\n file-deletion.",
                "--exclude(M)": "This option is a simplified form of the --filter option that defaults to an exclude\n rule and does not allow the full rule-parsing syntax of normal filter rules.",
                "--include(M)": "This option is a simplified form of the --filter option that defaults to an include\n rule and does not allow the full rule-parsing syntax of normal filter rules.",
                "--partial(M)": "By default, rsync will delete any partially transferred file if the transfer is\n interrupted. In some circumstances it is more desirable to keep partially\n transferred files. Using the --partial option tells rsync to keep the partial file\n which should make a subsequent transfer of the rest of the file much faster.",
                "--progress(M)": "This option tells rsync to print information showing the progress of the transfer.\n This gives a bored user something to watch. With a modern rsync this is the same\n as specifying --info=flist2,name,progress, but any user-supplied settings for those\n info flags takes precedence (e.g. \"--info=flist0 --progress\").",
                "--rsh(M)": "This option allows you to choose an alternative remote shell program to use for\n communication between the local and remote copies of rsync. Typically, rsync is\n configured to use ssh by default, but you may prefer to use rsh on a local network.",
                "-a(M)": "This is equivalent to -rlptgoD. It is a quick way of saying you want recursion and\n want to preserve almost everything (with -H being a notable omission). The only\n exception to the above equivalence is when --files-from is specified, in which case\n -r is not implied.",
                "-e(M)": "This option allows you to choose an alternative remote shell program to use for\n communication between the local and remote copies of rsync. Typically, rsync is\n configured to use ssh by default, but you may prefer to use rsh on a local network.",
                "-m(M)": "This option tells the receiving rsync to get rid of empty directories from the\n file-list, including nested directories that have no non-directory children. This\n is useful for avoiding the creation of a bunch of useless directories when the\n sending rsync is recursively scanning a hierarchy of files using\n include/exclude/filter rules.",
                "-v(M)": "This option increases the amount of information you are given during the transfer.\n By default, rsync works silently. A single -v will give you information about what\n files are being transferred and a brief summary at the end. Two -v options will\n give you information on what files are being skipped and slightly more information\n at the end. More than two -v options should only be used if you are debugging\n rsync.",
                "-z(M)": "With this option, rsync compresses the file data as it is sent to the destination\n machine, which reduces the amount of data being transmitted - something that is\n useful over a slow connection."

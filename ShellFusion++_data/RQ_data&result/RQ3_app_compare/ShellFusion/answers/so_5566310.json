                "-name(M)": "This option is supported, but POSIX conformance depends on the POSIX conformance of\n the system's fnmatch(3) library function. As of findutils-4.2.2, shell\n metacharacters (`*', `?' or `[]' for example) will match a leading `.', because\n IEEE PASC interpretation 126 requires this. This is a change from previous\n versions of findutils.",

                "-printf(C)": "If anything changes at all (new files, deleted files, modified files), then the checksum will change also! .  \"find . -type f -printf '%T@,' | cksum\" .   \"'%T@,'\" returns the modification time of each file as a unix timestamp, all on the same line. \"cksum\" calculates the checksum of the timestamps. ???? Profit!!!!  It's actually even faster than the previous solution (by ~20%), because we don't need to sort (which is one of the slowest operations).",
                "-printf(M)": "True; print format on the standard output, interpreting `\\' escapes and `%'\n directives. Field widths and precisions can be specified as with the `printf' C\n function. Please note that many of the fields are printed as %s rather than %d,\n and this may mean that flags don't work as you might expect. This also means that\n the `-' flag does work (it forces fields to be left-aligned). Unlike -print,\n -printf does not add a newline at the end of the string. The escapes and\n directives are:",

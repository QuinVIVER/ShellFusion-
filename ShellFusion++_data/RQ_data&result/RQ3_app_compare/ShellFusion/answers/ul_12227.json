                "-S(M)": "When creating a new session, this option can be used to specify a meaningful name for\n the session. This name identifies the session for \"screen -list\" and \"screen -r\"\n actions. It substitutes the default [tty.host] suffix.",
                "-d(M)": "does not start screen, but detaches the elsewhere running screen session. It has the\n same effect as typing \"C-a d\" from screen's controlling terminal. -D is the\n equivalent to the power detach key. If no session can be detached, this option is\n ignored. In combination with the -r/-R option more powerful effects can be achieved:",
                "-i(M)": "will cause the interrupt key (usually C-c) to interrupt the display immediately when\n flow-control is on. See the \"defflow\" .screenrc command for details. The use of\n this option is discouraged.",
                "-l(M)": "turns login mode on or off (for /run/utmp updating). This can also be defined\n through the \"deflogin\" .screenrc command.",
                "-r(C)": "The purpose of assigning a name to a screen session with \"-S\" is so you can operate on that session (for example with \"screen -r ...\") by specifying its name.",
                "-r(M)": " resumes a detached screen session. No other options (except combinations with -d/-D)\n may be specified, though an optional prefix of [pid.]tty.host may be needed to\n distinguish between multiple detached screen sessions. The second form is used to\n connect to another user's screen session which runs in multiuser mode. This indicates\n that screen should look for sessions in another user's directory. This requires\n setuid-root.",
                "-s(M)": "sets the default shell to the program specified, instead of the value in the\n environment variable $SHELL (or \"/bin/sh\" if not defined). This can also be defined\n through the \"shell\" .screenrc command. See also there.",
                "-t(M)": "sets the title (a.k.a.) for the default shell or specified program. See also the\n \"shelltitle\" .screenrc command."

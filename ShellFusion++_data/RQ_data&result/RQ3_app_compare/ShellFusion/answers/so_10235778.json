            "Explanations about Options": {
                "--partial(M)": "By default, rsync will delete any partially transferred file if the transfer is\n interrupted. In some circumstances it is more desirable to keep partially\n transferred files. Using the --partial option tells rsync to keep the partial file\n which should make a subsequent transfer of the rest of the file much faster.",
                "--progress(M)": "This option tells rsync to print information showing the progress of the transfer.\n This gives a bored user something to watch. With a modern rsync this is the same\n as specifying --info=flist2,name,progress, but any user-supplied settings for those\n info flags takes precedence (e.g. \"--info=flist0 --progress\").",
                "--rsh(M)": "This option allows you to choose an alternative remote shell program to use for\n communication between the local and remote copies of rsync. Typically, rsync is\n configured to use ssh by default, but you may prefer to use rsh on a local network."

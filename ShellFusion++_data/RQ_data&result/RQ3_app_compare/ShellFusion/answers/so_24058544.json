            "Command": "rsync",
            "Explanations about Options": {
                "--delete-during(M)": "Request that the file-deletions on the receiving side be done incrementally as the\n transfer happens. The per-directory delete scan is done right before each\n directory is checked for updates, so it behaves like a more efficient\n --delete-before, including doing the deletions prior to any per-directory filter\n files being updated. This option was first added in rsync version 2.6.4. See\n --delete (which is implied) for more details on file-deletion.",
                "--quiet(M)": "This option decreases the amount of information you are given during the transfer,\n notably suppressing information messages from the remote server. This option is\n useful when invoking rsync from cron.",
                "-A(M)": "This option causes rsync to update the destination ACLs to be the same as the\n source ACLs. The option also implies --perms.",
                "-X(M)": "This option causes rsync to update the destination extended attributes to be the\n same as the source ones.",
                "-a(M)": "This is equivalent to -rlptgoD. It is a quick way of saying you want recursion and\n want to preserve almost everything (with -H being a notable omission). The only\n exception to the above equivalence is when --files-from is specified, in which case\n -r is not implied.",
                "-e(M)": "This option allows you to choose an alternative remote shell program to use for\n communication between the local and remote copies of rsync. Typically, rsync is\n configured to use ssh by default, but you may prefer to use rsh on a local network.",
                "-h(M)": "Output numbers in a more human-readable format. There are 3 possible levels: (1)\n output numbers with a separator between each set of 3 digits (either a comma or a\n period, depending on if the decimal point is represented by a period or a comma);\n (2) output numbers in units of 1000 (with a character suffix for larger units --\n see below); (3) output numbers in units of 1024.",
                "-i(M)": "Requests a simple itemized list of the changes that are being made to each file,\n including attribute changes. This is exactly the same as specifying\n --out-format='%i %n%L'. If you repeat the option, unchanged files will also be\n output, but only if the receiving rsync is at least version 2.6.7 (you can use -vv\n with older versions of rsync, but that also turns on the output of other verbose\n messages).",
                "-r(M)": "This tells rsync to copy directories recursively. See also --dirs (-d).",
                "-v(M)": "This option increases the amount of information you are given during the transfer.\n By default, rsync works silently. A single -v will give you information about what\n files are being transferred and a brief summary at the end. Two -v options will\n give you information on what files are being skipped and slightly more information\n at the end. More than two -v options should only be used if you are debugging\n rsync."

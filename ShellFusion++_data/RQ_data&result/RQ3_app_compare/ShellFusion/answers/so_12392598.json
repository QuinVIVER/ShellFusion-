                "-H(M)": "Hash a known_hosts file. This replaces all hostnames and addresses with hashed\n representations within the specified file; the original content is moved to a file\n with a .old suffix. These hashes may be used normally by ssh and sshd, but they do\n not reveal identifying information should the file's contents be disclosed. This\n option will not modify existing hashed hostnames and is therefore safe to use on\n files that mix hashed and non-hashed names.",
                "-N(C)": "The command looks like this: .  \"ssh-keygen -p -N \"\" -m pem -f /path/to/key\".",

                "-f(M)": "Specifies the filename of the key file.",

                "-p(M)": "Requests changing the passphrase of a private key file instead of creating a new\n private key. The program will prompt for the file containing the private key, for\n the old passphrase, and twice for the new passphrase.",
                "-t(M)": "Specifies the type of key to create. The possible values are “rsa1” for protocol\n version 1 and “dsa”, “ecdsa”, “ed25519”, or “rsa” for protocol version 2."

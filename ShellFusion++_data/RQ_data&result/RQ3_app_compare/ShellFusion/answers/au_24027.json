                "-f(C)": "Boot to a Ubuntu Live USB/DVD and \"sudo fsck -f /dev/sdc1\" then \"resize2fs -f /dev/sdc1\". Do a resize2fs -p on the new home partition size just to make sure it has the correct block size. 4.2 Use lvextend on the ROOT partition and then do \"resize2fs PARTITION SIZE\" or \"resize2fs -f PARTITION SIZE\" on it. Do \"resize2fs PARTITION SIZE\" or \"resize2fs -f PARTITION SIZE\" to the HOME partition before you use lvreduce on it. First do \"e2fsck -f PARTITION\" Since we want to remove space from /home and give it to root we do: 4.1.",
                "-f(M)": "Forces resize2fs to proceed with the filesystem resize operation, overriding some\n safety checks which resize2fs normally enforces.",
                "-p(C)": "UPDATE : I actually replaced points 6) and 7) with the followings in order to not have to specify the \"root\" size exactly, but to extend to all the free space \"lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/mapper/APP05-root\" \"resize2fs -p /dev/mapper/APP05-root\". So, based on @wurtel's answer and the research I've done, here's the script and the steps I came up with. .  1) Unmount the \"home\" partition \"umount /dev/mapper/APP05-home\" .  2) Resize the \"home\" filesystem to a size of 2G \"resize2fs -p /dev/mapper/APP05-home 2G\" .  3) Reduce the size of the \"home\" logical volume to 2,1G (the volume needs to be a little bit bigger due to filesystem overhead) \"lvresize --size 2,1G /dev/mapper/APP05-home\" .  4) Resize the filesystem to match the logical volume's size \"resize2fs -p /dev/mapper/APP05-home\" .  5) Mount back the \"home\" partition \"mount /dev/mapper/APP05-home /home\" .  6) Increase the size of the \"root\" logical volume to 17.2G \"lvresize --size 17.2G /dev/mapper/APP05-root\" .  7) Increase the \"root\" filesystem to a size of 17.2G \"resize2fs -p /dev/mapper/APP05-root 17.2G\". And do again a resize2fs -p on it to make sure it has the correct block size.",
                "-p(M)": "Prints out a percentage completion bars for each resize2fs operation during an\n offline resize, so that the user can keep track of what the program is doing."

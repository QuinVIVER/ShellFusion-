            "Explanations about Options": {
                "-S(M)": "If any of these options is used, then the linker is not run, and object file names\n should not be used as arguments.",
                "-Wall(C)": "Compile your (user-space) code with all warnings and debug info: \"gcc -Wall -Wextra -g\" with GCC.",
                "-Wall(M)": "turns on the following warning flags:",
                "-Wextra(M)": "This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled by -Wall. (This option used\n to be called -W. The older name is still supported, but the newer name is more\n descriptive.)",
                "-g(M)": "Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format (stabs, COFF,\n XCOFF, or DWARF). GDB can work with this debugging information.",
                "-o(M)": "Place output in file file. This applies to whatever sort of output is being produced,\n whether it be an executable file, an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C\n code.",
                "-pthread(M)": "Link with the POSIX threads library. This option is supported on GNU/Linux targets,\n most other Unix derivatives, and also on x86 Cygwin and MinGW targets. On some\n targets this option also sets flags for the preprocessor, so it should be used\n consistently for both compilation and linking."

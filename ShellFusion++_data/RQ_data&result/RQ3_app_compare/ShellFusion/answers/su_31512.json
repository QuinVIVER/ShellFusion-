                "--ignore-existing(M)": "This tells rsync to skip updating files that already exist on the destination (this\n does not ignore existing directories, or nothing would get done). See also\n --existing.",
                "-a(M)": "This is equivalent to -rlptgoD. It is a quick way of saying you want recursion and\n want to preserve almost everything (with -H being a notable omission). The only\n exception to the above equivalence is when --files-from is specified, in which case\n -r is not implied.",

Unlike\n --recursive, a directoryâ€™s contents are not copied unless the directory name\n specified is \".\" or ends with a trailing slash (e.g. \".\", \"dir/.\", \"dir/\", etc.).\n Without this option or the --recursive option, rsync will skip all directories it\n encounters (and output a message to that effect for each one). If you specify both\n --dirs and --recursive, --recursive takes precedence.",
                "-e(M)": "This option allows you to choose an alternative remote shell program to use for\n communication between the local and remote copies of rsync. Typically, rsync is\n configured to use ssh by default, but you may prefer to use rsh on a local network.",
                "-r(M)": "This tells rsync to copy directories recursively. See also --dirs (-d).",
                "-v(M)": "This option increases the amount of information you are given during the transfer.\n By default, rsync works silently. A single -v will give you information about what\n files are being transferred and a brief summary at the end. Two -v options will\n give you information on what files are being skipped and slightly more information\n at the end. More than two -v options should only be used if you are debugging\n rsync.",
                "-z(M)": "With this option, rsync compresses the file data as it is sent to the destination\n machine, which reduces the amount of data being transmitted - something that is\n useful over a slow connection."

                "-f(M)": "Causes everything to be done except for the actual system call; if it's not\n obvious, this ``fakes'' mounting the filesystem. This option is useful in\n conjunction with the -v flag to determine what the mount command is trying to do.\n It can also be used to add entries for devices that were mounted earlier with the\n -n option. The -f option checks for an existing record in /etc/mtab and fails when\n the record already exists (with a regular non-fake mount, this check is done by the\n kernel).",

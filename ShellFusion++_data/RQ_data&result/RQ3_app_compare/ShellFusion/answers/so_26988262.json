                "-d(M)": "A synonym for -depth, for compatibility with FreeBSD, NetBSD, MacOS X and OpenBSD.",
                "-empty(M)": "File is empty and is either a regular file or a directory.",
                "-mtime(M)": "File's data was last modified n*24 hours ago. See the comments for -atime to\n understand how rounding affects the interpretation of file modification times.",
                "-name(M)": "This option is supported, but POSIX conformance depends on the POSIX conformance of\n the system's fnmatch(3) library function. As of findutils-4.2.2, shell\n metacharacters (`*', `?' or `[]' for example) will match a leading `.', because\n IEEE PASC interpretation 126 requires this. This is a change from previous\n versions of findutils.",
                "-regex(M)": "File name matches regular expression pattern. This is a match on the whole path,\n not a search. For example, to match a file named `./fubar3', you can use the\n regular expression `.*bar.' or `.*b.*3', but not `f.*r3'. The regular expressions\n understood by find are by default Emacs Regular Expressions (except that `.'\n matches newline), but this can be changed with the -regextype option.",
                "-regextype(M)": "Changes the regular expression syntax understood by -regex and -iregex tests which\n occur later on the command line. To see which regular expression types are known,\n use -regextype help. The Texinfo documentation (see SEE ALSO) explains the meaning\n of and differences between the various types of regular expression.",
                "-type(C)": "You should be able to use \"find . -type d -empty\".",

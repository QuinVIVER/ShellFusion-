                "-e(M)": "This option specifies the program (and its command line arguments) to be run in\n the xterm window. It also sets the window title and icon name to be the basename\n of the program being executed if neither -T nor -n are given on the command line.",
                "-fullscreen(M)": "This option indicates that xterm should ask the window manager to let it use the\n full-screen for display, e.g., without window decorations. It sets the fullscreen\n resource to “true”.",
                "-l(M)": "Turn logging on, unless disabled by the logInhibit resource.",
                "-n(M)": "This option specifies the icon name for xterm's windows. It is shorthand for\n specifying the “iconName” resource. Note that this is not the same as the toolkit\n option -name. The default icon name is the application name.",
                "-r(M)": "This option indicates that reverse video should be simulated by swapping the\n foreground and background colors. It is equivalent to -rv.",
                "-s(M)": "This option indicates that xterm may scroll asynchronously, meaning that the\n screen does not have to be kept completely up to date while scrolling. This\n allows xterm to run faster when network latencies are very high and is typically\n useful when running across a very large internet or many gateways."

It may be useful to check with \"fdisk -l /dev/sdx\" or \"cat /proc/partitions\" first. Have you been resizing partitions? Pending the output of \"sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda\" I wonder if the partition \"/dev/sda3\" as defined by the disk partition table (which fdisk will tell us) is 70.50 GiB, while the filesystem on the partition is only 25 GB.",

      "Explanations about Options": {
        "-a": "This is equivalent to -rlptgoD. It is a quick way of saying you want recursion and\n want to preserve almost everything (with -H being a notable omission). The only\n exception to the above equivalence is when --files-from is specified, in which case\n -r is not implied.",
        "-v": "This option increases the amount of information you are given during the transfer.\n By default, rsync works silently. A single -v will give you information about what\n files are being transferred and a brief summary at the end. Two -v options will\n give you information on what files are being skipped and slightly more information\n at the end. More than two -v options should only be used if you are debugging\n rsync.",
        "-x": "This tells rsync to avoid crossing a filesystem boundary when recursing. This does\n not limit the user\u2019s ability to specify items to copy from multiple filesystems,\n just rsync\u2019s recursion through the hierarchy of each directory that the user\n specified, and also the analogous recursion on the receiving side during deletion.\n Also keep in mind that rsync treats a \"bind\" mount to the same device as being on\n the same filesystem.",
        "--remove-source-files": "This tells rsync to remove from the sending side the files (meaning\n non-directories) that are a part of the transfer and have been successfully\n duplicated on the receiving side.",
        "-E": "This option causes rsync to preserve the executability (or non-executability) of\n regular files when --perms is not enabled. A regular file is considered to be\n executable if at least one \u2019x\u2019 is turned on in its permissions. When an existing\n destination file\u2019s executability differs from that of the corresponding source\n file, rsync modifies the destination file\u2019s permissions as follows:",
        "-S": "Try to handle sparse files efficiently so they take up less space on the\n destination. If combined with --inplace the file created might not end up with\n sparse blocks with some combinations of kernel version and/or filesystem type. If\n --whole-file is in effect (e.g. for a local copy) then it will always work because\n rsync truncates the file prior to writing out the updated version."

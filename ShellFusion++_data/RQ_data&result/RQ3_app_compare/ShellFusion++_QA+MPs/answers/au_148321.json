        "--pidfile": "Check whether a process has created the file pid-file.",
        "--stop": "Checks for the existence of a specified process. If such a process exists,\n start-stop-daemon sends it the signal specified by --signal, and exits with error\n status 0. If such a process does not exist, start-stop-daemon exits with error\n status 1 (0 if --oknodo is specified). If --retry is specified, then\n start-stop-daemon will check that the process(es) have terminated.",
        "--quiet": "Do not print informational messages; only display error messages.",
        "--retry": "With --stop, specifies that start-stop-daemon is to check whether the process(es)\n do finish. It will check repeatedly whether any matching processes are running,\n until none are. If the processes do not exit it will then take further action as\n determined by the schedule.",
        "--name": "Check for processes with the name process-name. The process-name is usually the\n process filename, but it could have been changed by the process itself. Note: on\n most systems this information is retrieved from the process comm name from the\n kernel, which tends to have a relatively short length limit (assuming more than 15\n characters is non-portable)."

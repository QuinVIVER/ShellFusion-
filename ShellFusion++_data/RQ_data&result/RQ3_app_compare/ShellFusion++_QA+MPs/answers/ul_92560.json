        "-a": "Disables forwarding of the authentication agent connection.",
        "-q": "Quiet mode. Causes most warning and diagnostic messages to be suppressed.",
        "-o": "Can be used to give options in the format used in the configuration file. This is\n useful for specifying options for which there is no separate command-line flag. For\n full details of the options listed below, and their possible values, see\n ssh_config(5).",
        "-w": "Requests tunnel device forwarding with the specified tun(4) devices between the\n client (local_tun) and the server (remote_tun).",
        "-e": "Sets the escape character for sessions with a pty (default: \u2018~\u2019). The escape\n character is only recognized at the beginning of a line. The escape character\n followed by a dot (\u2018.\u2019) closes the connection; followed by control-Z suspends the\n connection; and followed by itself sends the escape character once. Setting the\n character to \u201cnone\u201d disables any escapes and makes the session fully transparent.",
        "-t": "Force pseudo-terminal allocation. This can be used to execute arbitrary screen-\n based programs on a remote machine, which can be very useful, e.g. when implementing\n menu services. Multiple -t options force tty allocation, even if ssh has no local\n tty.",

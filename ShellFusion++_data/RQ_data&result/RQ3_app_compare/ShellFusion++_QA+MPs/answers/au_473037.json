        "--suspend-hybrid": "Test whether hybrid-suspend is supported. Hybrid-suspend is the process where first\n the state of the system is saved to disk - just like with hibernate - but instead of\n poweroff, the system goes in suspend state, which means it can wakeup quicker than for\n normal hibernation. The advantage over suspend is that you can resume even if you run\n out of power. s2both is a hybrid-suspend implementation."

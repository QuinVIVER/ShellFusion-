      "Explanations about Options": {
        "-keyout": "This gives the filename to write the newly created private key to. If this option is\n not specified then the filename present in the configuration file is used.",
        "-nodes": "If this option is specified then if a private key is created it will not be encrypted.",
        "-x509": "This option outputs a self signed certificate instead of a certificate request. This\n is typically used to generate a test certificate or a self signed root CA. The\n extensions added to the certificate (if any) are specified in the configuration file.\n Unless specified using the set_serial option, a large random number will be used for\n the serial number.",
        "-out": "This specifies the output filename to write to or standard output by default.",
        "-newkey": "This option creates a new certificate request and a new private key. The argument\n takes one of several forms. rsa:nbits, where nbits is the number of bits, generates an\n RSA key nbits in size. If nbits is omitted, i.e. -newkey rsa specified, the default\n key size, specified in the configuration file is used.",
        "-days": "When the -x509 option is being used this specifies the number of days to certify the\n certificate for, otherwise it is ignored. n should be a positive integer. The default\n is 30 days.",
        "-config": "This allows an alternative configuration file to be specified. Optional; for a\n description of the default value, see \"COMMAND SUMMARY\" in openssl(1)."

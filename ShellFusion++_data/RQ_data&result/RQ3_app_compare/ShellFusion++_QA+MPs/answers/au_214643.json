        "-e": " Use entry as the explicit symbol for beginning execution of your program, rather than\n the default entry point. If there is no symbol named entry, the linker will try to\n parse entry as a number, and use that as the entry address (the number will be\n interpreted in base 10; you may use a leading 0x for base 16, or a leading 0 for base\n 8).",

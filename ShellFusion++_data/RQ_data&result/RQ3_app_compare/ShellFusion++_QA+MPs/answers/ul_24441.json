        "so_1408272: 3.1)  How do I find the creation time of a file?\n\n      You can't - it isn't stored anywhere.  Files have a last-modified\n      time (shown by \"ls -l\"), a last-accessed time (shown by \"ls -lu\")\n      and an inode change time (shown by \"ls -lc\"). The latter is often\n      referred to as the \"creation time\" - even in some man pages -\n      but that's wrong; it's also set by such operations as mv, ln,\n      chmod, chown and chgrp.\n\n      The man page for \"stat(2)\" discusses this."

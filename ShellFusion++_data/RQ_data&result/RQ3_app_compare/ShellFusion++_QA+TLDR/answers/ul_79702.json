        "-quit": "Exit immediately. No child processes will be left running, but no more paths\n specified on the command line will be processed. For example, find /tmp/foo\n /tmp/bar -print -quit will print only /tmp/foo. Any command lines which have been\n built up with -execdir ... {} + will be invoked before find exits. The exit status\n may or may not be zero, depending on whether an error has already occurred.",
        "-print": "Quoting is handled in the same way as for -printf and -fprintf. If you are using\n find in a script or in a situation where the matched files might have arbitrary\n names, you should consider using -print0 instead of -print.",
        "-name": "This option is supported, but POSIX conformance depends on the POSIX conformance of\n the system's fnmatch(3) library function. As of findutils-4.2.2, shell\n metacharacters (`*', `?' or `[]' for example) will match a leading `.', because\n IEEE PASC interpretation 126 requires this. This is a change from previous\n versions of findutils.",
        "-maxdepth": "Descend at most levels (a non-negative integer) levels of directories below the\n starting-points. -maxdepth 0 means only apply the tests and actions to the\n starting-points themselves."

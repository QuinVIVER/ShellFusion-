      "Explanations about Options": {
        "-e": "This option allows you to choose an alternative remote shell program to use for\n communication between the local and remote copies of rsync. Typically, rsync is\n configured to use ssh by default, but you may prefer to use rsh on a local network.",
        "-z": "With this option, rsync compresses the file data as it is sent to the destination\n machine, which reduces the amount of data being transmitted - something that is\n useful over a slow connection.",
        "-a": "This is equivalent to -rlptgoD. It is a quick way of saying you want recursion and\n want to preserve almost everything (with -H being a notable omission). The only\n exception to the above equivalence is when --files-from is specified, in which case\n -r is not implied.",
        "-v": "This option increases the amount of information you are given during the transfer.\n By default, rsync works silently. A single -v will give you information about what\n files are being transferred and a brief summary at the end. Two -v options will\n give you information on what files are being skipped and slightly more information\n at the end. More than two -v options should only be used if you are debugging\n rsync."

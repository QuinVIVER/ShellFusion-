These fields are specified in POSIX.1-2008, and, starting with version 2.12,  glibc  also\n   exposes  these  field  names if _POSIX_C_SOURCE is defined with the value 200809L or greater, or _XOPEN_SOURCE is defined\n   with the value 700 or greater.  If none of the aforementioned macros are defined, then the nanosecond values are  exposed\n   with names of the form st_atimensec.

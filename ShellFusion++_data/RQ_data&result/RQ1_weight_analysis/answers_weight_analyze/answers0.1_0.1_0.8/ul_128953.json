        "-i": "Starts top with the last remembered `i' state reversed. When this toggle is Off,\n tasks that have not used any CPU since the last update will not be displayed. For\n additional information regarding this toggle see topic 4c. TASK AREA Commands, SIZE.",

        "-o": "Specifies the name of the field on which tasks will be sorted, independent of what is\n reflected in the configuration file. You can prepend a `+' or `-' to the field name\n to also override the sort direction. A leading `+' will force sorting high to low,\n whereas a `-' will ensure a low to high ordering."

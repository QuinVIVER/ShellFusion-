        "-p": "Attach to the process with the process ID pid and begin tracing. The trace\n may be terminated at any time by a keyboard interrupt signal (CTRL-C). strace\n will respond by detaching itself from the traced process(es) leaving it (them)\n to continue running. Multiple -p options can be used to attach to many\n processes in addition to command (which is optional if at least one -p option\n is given). -p \"`pidof PROG`\" syntax is supported.",
        "-f": "Trace child processes as they are created by currently traced processes as a\n result of the fork(2), vfork(2) and clone(2) system calls. Note that -p PID\n -f will attach all threads of process PID if it is multi-threaded, not only\n thread with thread_id = PID.",
        "-v": "Print unabbreviated versions of environment, stat, termios, etc. calls.\n These structures are very common in calls and so the default behavior displays\n a reasonable subset of structure members. Use this option to get all of the\n gory details."

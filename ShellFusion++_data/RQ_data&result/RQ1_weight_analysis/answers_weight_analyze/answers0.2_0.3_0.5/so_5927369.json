        "-regex": "File name matches regular expression pattern. This is a match on the whole path,\n not a search. For example, to match a file named `./fubar3', you can use the\n regular expression `.*bar.' or `.*b.*3', but not `f.*r3'. The regular expressions\n understood by find are by default Emacs Regular Expressions (except that `.'\n matches newline), but this can be changed with the -regextype option.",
        "-name": "This option is supported, but POSIX conformance depends on the POSIX conformance of\n the system's fnmatch(3) library function. As of findutils-4.2.2, shell\n metacharacters (`*', `?' or `[]' for example) will match a leading `.', because\n IEEE PASC interpretation 126 requires this. This is a change from previous\n versions of findutils.",
        "-print": "Quoting is handled in the same way as for -printf and -fprintf. If you are using\n find in a script or in a situation where the matched files might have arbitrary\n names, you should consider using -print0 instead of -print.",

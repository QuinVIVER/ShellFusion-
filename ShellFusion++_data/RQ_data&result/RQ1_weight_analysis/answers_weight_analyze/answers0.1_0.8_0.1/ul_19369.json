        "-name": "This option is supported, but POSIX conformance depends on the POSIX conformance of\n the system's fnmatch(3) library function. As of findutils-4.2.2, shell\n metacharacters (`*', `?' or `[]' for example) will match a leading `.', because\n IEEE PASC interpretation 126 requires this. This is a change from previous\n versions of findutils.",
        "-type": "File is of type c:",
        "-print": "Quoting is handled in the same way as for -printf and -fprintf. If you are using\n find in a script or in a situation where the matched files might have arbitrary\n names, you should consider using -print0 instead of -print.",
        "-mindepth": "Do not apply any tests or actions at levels less than levels (a non-negative\n integer). -mindepth 1 means process all files except the starting-points.",
        "-mtime": "File's data was last modified n*24 hours ago. See the comments for -atime to\n understand how rounding affects the interpretation of file modification times.",
        "-perm": "Any of the permission bits mode are set for the file. Symbolic modes are accepted\n in this form. You must specify `u', `g' or `o' if you use a symbolic mode. See\n the EXAMPLES section for some illustrative examples. If no permission bits in mode\n are set, this test matches any file (the idea here is to be consistent with the\n behaviour of -perm -000).",
        "-maxdepth": "Descend at most levels (a non-negative integer) levels of directories below the\n starting-points. -maxdepth 0 means only apply the tests and actions to the\n starting-points themselves."

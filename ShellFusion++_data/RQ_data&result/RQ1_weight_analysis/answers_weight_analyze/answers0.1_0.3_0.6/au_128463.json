        "--brightness": "Multiply the gamma values on the crtc currently attached to the output to specified\n floating value. Useful for overly bright or overly dim outputs. However, this is a\n software only modification, if your hardware has support to actually change the\n brightness, you will probably prefer to use xbacklight.",
        "--gamma": "Set the specified floating point values as gamma correction on the crtc currently\n attached to this output. Note that you cannot get two different values for cloned\n outputs (i.e.: which share the same crtc) and that switching an output to another\n crtc doesn't change the crtc gamma corrections at all.",

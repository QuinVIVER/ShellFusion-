        "-a": "This is equivalent to -rlptgoD. It is a quick way of saying you want recursion and\n want to preserve almost everything (with -H being a notable omission). The only\n exception to the above equivalence is when --files-from is specified, in which case\n -r is not implied.",
        "-p": "This option causes the receiving rsync to set the destination permissions to be the\n same as the source permissions. (See also the --chmod option for a way to modify\n what rsync considers to be the source permissions.)",
        "-z": "With this option, rsync compresses the file data as it is sent to the destination\n machine, which reduces the amount of data being transmitted - something that is\n useful over a slow connection.",
        "-e": "This option allows you to choose an alternative remote shell program to use for\n communication between the local and remote copies of rsync. Typically, rsync is\n configured to use ssh by default, but you may prefer to use rsh on a local network."

        "-d": "does not start screen, but detaches the elsewhere running screen session. It has the\n same effect as typing \"C-a d\" from screen's controlling terminal. -D is the\n equivalent to the power detach key. If no session can be detached, this option is\n ignored. In combination with the -r/-R option more powerful effects can be achieved:",
        "-U": "Run screen in UTF-8 mode. This option tells screen that your terminal sends and\n understands UTF-8 encoded characters. It also sets the default encoding for new\n windows to `utf8'.",
        "-S": "When creating a new session, this option can be used to specify a meaningful name for\n the session. This name identifies the session for \"screen -list\" and \"screen -r\"\n actions. It substitutes the default [tty.host] suffix.",
        "-r": " resumes a detached screen session. No other options (except combinations with -d/-D)\n may be specified, though an optional prefix of [pid.]tty.host may be needed to\n distinguish between multiple detached screen sessions. The second form is used to\n connect to another user's screen session which runs in multiuser mode. This indicates\n that screen should look for sessions in another user's directory.

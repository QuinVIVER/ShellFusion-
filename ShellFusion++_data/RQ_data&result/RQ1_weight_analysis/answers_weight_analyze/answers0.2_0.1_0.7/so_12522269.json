        "-name": "This option is supported, but POSIX conformance depends on the POSIX conformance of\n the system's fnmatch(3) library function. As of findutils-4.2.2, shell\n metacharacters (`*', `?' or `[]' for example) will match a leading `.', because\n IEEE PASC interpretation 126 requires this. This is a change from previous\n versions of findutils.",
        "-newer": "Time of the last data modification of the current file is more recent than that of\n the last data modification of the reference file. If reference is a symbolic link\n and the -H option or the -L option is in effect, then the time of the last data\n modification of the file it points to is always used.",
        "-print": "Quoting is handled in the same way as for -printf and -fprintf. If you are using\n find in a script or in a situation where the matched files might have arbitrary\n names, you should consider using -print0 instead of -print."
